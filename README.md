OpenMPLab
=========
The main point of this project is to speed it up as much as possible. We are given code that currently works,and 
are required to optimize as much possible for higher performance using OMP threads. Additionally, we are given free
reign over how we wish to speed the program up meaning we can rewrite functions to accomplish the same task. We can
also change the overall implementation so it uses only one dimensional arrays. As long as it produces the same output,
it is valid. We are only modifying one file, edgedetect.c which is the file that deals with the body of the code that is
used to grayscale the image.
